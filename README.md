# Denis Patric Trif

**`Software Tester (Bug Hunter/Investigator/Innovator)`**

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Denis, a 28-year-old who decided to pivot from being a financial advisor to embracing the dynamic world of software testing. Driven by a constant quest for knowledge and new challenges, I dreamed of a career that would allow me to continuously develop and leverage my talent for spotting inconsistencies.

<b>What are my skills?</b> During my training, I've learned <b>SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Confluence, Postman, GIT, and the basics of HTML/CSS.</b> My background as a financial advisor has sharpened my <b>attention to detail, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills, but also being a team player and a good communicator</b>, all of which are directly applicable to my role as a software tester. Just as I analyzed financial data to ensure accuracy and compliance, I now carefully examine and analyze software to ensure quality and functionality.
