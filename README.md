### <p align="center"> Who am I?

<p align="center"> I am a dedicated software tester with a continuous drive for self-improvement. I prioritize high quality and pay close attention to every detail of my work. Through my training, I have sharpened my skills in exploratory testing, website and mobile application testing, REST API testing, writing test cases, defect reporting, and creating test reports. I am proficient in using SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Confluence, Postman, GIT, and the basics of HTML/CSS. You can see the results of my work in my PORTFOLIO below ðŸ‘‡.
