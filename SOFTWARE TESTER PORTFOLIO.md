## <a name="aboutme">:mag_right: ABOUT ME</a>

<p align="justify">üëã Hello! I'm Denis, a 28-year-old who decided to pivot from being a financial advisor to embracing the dynamic world of software testing. Driven by a constant quest for knowledge and new challenges, I dreamed of a career that would allow me to continuously develop and leverage my talent for spotting inconsistencies.

What are my skills? During my training, I've learned SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Confluence, Postman, GIT, and the basics of HTML/CSS. My background as a financial advisor has sharpened my attention to detail, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to be a team player and a good communicator, all of which directly apply to my role as a software tester. Just as I analyzed financial data to ensure accuracy and compliance, I now carefully examine and analyze software to ensure quality and functionality</b>.</p>
